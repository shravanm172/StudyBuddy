# StudyBuddy
A full-stack web app built with React, Flask, PostgreSQL, and Firebase, which connects users with other students in their courses to form study groups. 

Users can form study groups by finding users in their courses in the People feed and sending them direct requests, or by finding existing groups on the public feed and requesting to join them
